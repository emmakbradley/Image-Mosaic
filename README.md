# Math155_FinalProject

Hello and welcome to my group's final project for MATH 155 - Mathematical Imaging, a course I took in Spring 2023 at UCLA. My fellow contributers included Cate Whitehouse, Ashley Kim, and Isabella Rodriguez and the project was done entirely in MATLAB.

This project reads in an image and outputs a tiled version of that image. We refer to this tiled version as the image mosaic. The tiles used in the mosaic are a set of 500 random images we scraped from Unsplash. 

In executing this project, we were able to refine our skills in image processing, working with the RGB model, image segmentation, problem solving, and collaboration.
